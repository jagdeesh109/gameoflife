# gameoflife

## Motivation
<p>
Appreciating TDD  with gameoflife, For me game of life is not about the program, Its about trying to understand about species, which are starting at a very small level, that is living cell. </p>
<p>
I thank to sir "John Horton Conway" for his recognition and discovery of such a wonder full concept. The concept will help us understand about behaviour of a cell.
</p>
<p>
Practically a docter who does moniter life cycle of cell at laboratory. The approxmiate behaviour of the cell can be understood using a simulated results by a program
</p>

##Important note

<p>
The library is under active development. APIs should be considered [unstable] and can be changed drastically.
</p>

##Docs

<p>
Working on documentation, tutorials.
</p>

## How it works
<p>
Game of life works on certain predefined rules. At initial level a single cell is defined, each cell will have individual behaviour based on the rules defined. we will extend behaviour of the cell to 1-Dimension,2-Dimension,3-Dimension till N-Dimension. We will also observe pattern genrated in each dimension
