# gameoflife

## Motivation
<p>
Appreciating TDD  with gameoflife, For me game of life is not about the program, Its about trying to understand about species, which are starting at a very small level, that is living cell. </p>
<p>
I thank to sir "John Horton Conway" for his recognition and discovery of such a wonder full concept. The concept will help us understand about behaviour of a cell.
</p>
<p>
Practically a docter who does moniter life cycle of cell at laboratory. The approxmiate behaviour of the cell can be understood using a simulated results by a program
